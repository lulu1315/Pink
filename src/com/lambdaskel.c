\brief grayscale filtered topological skeleton

<B>Usage:</B> lambdaskel in.pgm {imcond.pgm|null} connex lambda out.pgm

<B>Description:</B>
Filtered topological skeleton for 2D grayscale images. 
The parameter \b connex gives the connectivity used for the minima;
possible choices are 4 and 8.
The parameter \b lambda is a contrast parameter (positive integer).
Let F be the function corresponding to the input image \b in.pgm.
The parameter \b imcond.pgm is a constraint function G.
The algorithm is the following:

\verbatim
Repeat until stability:
    Select a point p which is lambda-destructible for F or a peak
        such that F(p) > G(p) and such that F(p) is minimal
    F(p) = alpha-(p,F)
Result: F
\endverbatim
